## relib-mss 0.14.0

- **Breaking: `ZmddNode::extract` now reports dense vectors.** Every variable of the structure function is present, with the components the diagram does not record filled in at their baseline — state `0` for a path family, the max state for a cut family. The baseline rule flips between the two, so the previous sparse output could not be read without knowing which family it came from.

- **New: `ZmddNode::extract_level`** — the classical minimal path/cut vectors *at level* `v` (`minimal{x : φ(x) >= v}` / `maximal{x : φ(x) <= v}`). This is **not** what `extract([v])` returns: a family stratifies each vector under the label equal to its own `φ(x)`, so `extract([v])` is the `φ(x) == v` stratum. The two agree at the extreme labels (there `φ >= v ⟺ φ == v`, resp. `φ <= v ⟺ φ == v`) but differ in between — a cut vector with `φ(x) < v` can still be maximal within `{x : φ(x) <= v}`. The documentation previously described `extract` itself as the `<= v` reading, which was wrong; `test_mincut_matches_bruteforce` only passed because its structure functions happened not to distinguish the two. It is now a definition-based check (φ(x) == label, every +1 step exceeds the label, nothing genuine missing) plus a new `test_mincut_levels_vs_strata` regression on a function that does distinguish them.

- **New: `ZmddNode::labels` / `is_cut` / `vars`** — the terminal labels the family stratifies over, whether it is a cut or path family, and the variables (with state counts) used to densify.

- **Fixed: the baseline member is now always present.** A family from a boolean structure function used to lose the trivial all-0 (path) / all-max (cut) vector that a value-forest family kept. Both now carry it, at label `φ(0,..,0)` resp. `φ(max,..,max)`. It is a correct but trivial minimal vector, so callers usually skip it.

## relib-mss 0.13.1

- `ZmddNode::dot` follows the `relib-mdd` change: the `Undet` terminal (the empty family) and the edges into it are omitted.

## relib-mss 0.13.0

- **New: `ZmddNode::dot`** — Graphviz source for a minimal path/cut vector family, mirroring `MddNode::dot` (backed by the new `Dot` impl in `relib-mdd`). Edge labels are the raw edge indices; for a `reverse` (cut) family `extract` reports `edge_num-1 - d`, but the diagram is the raw one.

## relib-mss 0.12.0

- **New: minimal cut vectors — `MssMgr::mincut`** returns the minimal cut vectors of a coherent
  structure function as a genuine `ZmddNode` (or `None` if non-coherent). Computed **directly**
  by a new `maxsol` pass (`mdd_minsol::maxsol`, the top-baseline mirror of `minsol`) — the dual
  `φ^D` is never materialized, avoiding the expensive multi-state edge/value reversal. The
  result is a *cut* ZMDD (`ZmddNode` now carries a `reverse` flag): its `extract` lists the
  components pushed below max ("levels below max" coordinates, undone by the reader), with an
  unlisted component meaning that variable stays at its max state, and the terminal label is the
  resulting performance value in φ's own scale (so a boolean fault-tree failure is read with
  `extract([0])`). `zmdd_convert::to_zmdd` gained a `reverse` parameter (reverses each node's
  edge order to put the baseline back on edge 0).
- **Docs**: `bmeas` rustdoc documents its interval-arithmetic behavior — a generic interval `T`
  gives a guaranteed but *conservative* enclosure (dependency problem + worst-case subtraction in
  the `D_j` difference; `Σ_j p = 1` not enforced).

## relib-mss 0.11.0

- **New: multi-state Birnbaum importance — `MddNode::bmeas`** (`mdd_prob::bmeas`). Returns,
  per variable, the adjacent-state differences
  `D_{i,j} = P(φ∈ss | x_i=j) − P(φ∈ss | x_i=j−1)` (vector length `M_i − 1`), computed in one
  backward-differentiation pass — the multi-state generalization of `relib-bss`'s `bmeas`
  (which is the binary case `P(φ∈ss|x=1) − P(φ∈ss|x=0)`). The difference form is the correct
  quantity on a reduced diagram: variables skipped on a path are irrelevant there and cancel
  out of every `D_{i,j}`. Real-valued only this round (no interval version yet).

## relib-mss 0.10.0

- **New: `ZmddMgr` / `ZmddNode`** — minimal path vector families as genuine ZMDDs, with the
  label-wise set operations `intersect` / `setdiff`, plus `count` / `extract`. (Only
  `intersect`/`setdiff` this round — see the crate TODO for the rest.)
- **New: `MssMgr`** — the multi-state manager, mirroring `bss::BssMgr`. It owns an `MddMgr`
  (structure functions over MTMDD2) and a `ZmddMgr` (families), and provides the analysis
  spanning both: **`MssMgr::minpath(&node) -> Option<ZmddNode>`** returns the minimal path
  vectors as a genuine ZMDD family. Build expressions through the delegated MDD API
  (`defvar`/`rpn`/`min`/`max`/… or the `MddNode` operators).
- **Source reorg** (mirrors the `bss` layout `bdd.rs`/`bss.rs`/`zdd.rs`): the MDD wrapper
  moved from `mss.rs` to **`mdd.rs`** (`MddMgr`/`MddNode`); new **`mss.rs`** holds `MssMgr`;
  `zmdd.rs` is the ZMDD wrapper. Prelude re-exports unchanged, so `use mss::prelude::*` still
  works.
- **Breaking / removed** (superseded by the genuine `ZmddNode`, as on the BSS side):
  - `minpath` moved off `MddNode` onto `MssMgr` and now returns a genuine `ZmddNode`
    (was an `MddNode` read with ZMDD semantics via `ZmddMgr::from_minsol`).
  - Removed the fake-ZMDD readers `MddNode::zmdd_extract` / `MddNode::zmdd_count`,
    `mdd_path::ZMddPath`, and `mdd_count::{zmdd_count, vzmdd_count, bzmdd_count}`.
    `MddNode::mdd_extract` / `mdd_count` (full assignments) are retained.
  - The ZMDD path iterator `ZmddSetPath` was renamed `ZmddPath` (parity with `bss::ZddPath`).

## relib-mss 0.9.1

- **Bug fix (correctness): `minpath` / `mincut` produced non-minimal path/cut vectors**
  for structure functions involving subsumption (e.g. `max(min(x,y), z)` gained a spurious
  `(y=1,z=2)`; the boolean `x&y|z` gained `{y,z}`). Conjunctive shapes (`min`) were
  unaffected. Root cause: `mdd_minsol::{vwithout,bwithout}` expanded every branch of the
  reference cofactor when the minsol family was a terminal, fabricating vectors with
  positive components that should be 0. Fixed to recurse into the reference's **zero
  branch** only (same principle as the existing `level(f) > level(g)` arm). Verified
  exhaustively against brute-force minimal path vectors for all monotone functions of
  n=3/K=2 and n=2/K=3.

## relib-mss 0.9.0

- Version bump for workspace lockstep; no functional changes. (`relib-mss`: the multi-state minsol/minpath is unchanged; the ZDD set-family work landed in `relib-bss` only.)

## relib-mss 0.8.0

- Version bump for workspace lockstep; no functional changes. (`dual`/`mincut`
  were added to `relib-bss` only; the multi-state dual is deferred.)

## relib-mss 0.7.0

- **Breaking**: `MddNode::minpath` now returns `Option<MddNode<V>>` (`None` when
  the structure function is not coherent). `minpath_checked` and the panicking
  behavior are removed — a single `minpath()` returns the minimal path/cut
  vectors or `None`.

## relib-mss 0.6.0

- Coherence-checked `minpath`. `MddNode::minpath_checked() -> Option<MddNode<V>>`
  returns `None` when the structure function is not coherent (monotone). Detection
  is folded into the minsol recursion via the local invariant "cofactors ascend
  pointwise", an O(1) id compare on the canonical diagram after one meet apply:
  `and(c[i-1], c[i]) == c[i-1]` on the boolean forest, `min(c[i-1], c[i]) == c[i-1]`
  on the value (MTMDD) forest. Aborts on the first violation.
- `minpath()` keeps its signature but now **panics** on a non-coherent input
  (previously silently-wrong).
- **Breaking**: `mdd_minsol::minsol` now returns `Option<Node>`.
